# Objective

This is a coding exercise which will allow you to demonstrate how you code and your approach to a given problem. 

You will be assessed on: 
- Your ability to write clean, well-tested and reusable code.
- How you have ensured the following business rules are correctly met.

# Business Rules

- There are 3 types of tickets i.e. Infant, Child, and Adult.
- The ticket prices are based on the type of ticket (see table below).
- The ticket purchaser declares how many and what type of tickets they want to buy.
- Multiple tickets can be purchased at any given time.
- Only a maximum of 20 tickets that can be purchased at a time.
- Infants do not pay for a ticket and are not allocated a seat. They will be sitting on an Adult's lap.
- Child and Infant tickets cannot be purchased without purchasing an Adult ticket.

|   Ticket Type    |     Price   |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
|    INFANT        |    £0       |
|    CHILD         |    £10      |
|    ADULT         |    £20      |

- There is an existing TicketPaymentService responsible for taking payments.
- There is an existing SeatReservationService responsible for reserving seats.

## Constraints

- The TicketService interface CANNOT be modified.
- The Java code in the thirdparty.* packages CANNOT be modified.
- The TicketTypeRequest SHOULD be an immutable object.

## Assumptions

You can assume:
- All accounts with an id greater than zero are valid. They also have sufficient funds to pay for any no of tickets.
- The TicketPaymentService implementation is an external provider with no defects. You do not need to worry about how the actual payment happens.
- The payment will always go through once a payment request has been made to the TicketPaymentService.
- The SeatReservationService implementation is an external provider with no defects. You do not need to worry about how the seat reservation algorithm works.
- The seat will always be reserved once a reservation request has been made to the SeatReservationService.


## Your Task

Provide a working implementation of a TicketService that:

- Considers the above objective, business rules, constraints & assumptions.
- Calculates the correct amount for the requested tickets and makes a payment request to the TicketPaymentService.  
- Calculates the correct no of seats to reserve and makes a seat reservation request to the SeatReservationService.  
- Rejects any invalid ticket purchase requests. It is up to you to identify what should be deemed as an invalid purchase request.
